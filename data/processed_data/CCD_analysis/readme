Files created during the DR screen and analysis of chromatin context dependent effects
All files will include datetags that show the date they were generated. Older versions will be moved to 'old_files' directory.
This directory only contains intermediate files. Table S3 that includes main results of the screen are in the main folder.

File list:
screening_raw_data_repair_metrics.rds - This file includes raw CRISPR efficiencies and log2MMEJNHEJ balances
differentials_log2_MMEJ_NHEJ_balance.rds - This file includes all the log2 transformed MMEJNHEJ balance scores
z_test_null_distribution_parameters.rds - This file includes paramenter to calculate the mock KO fitted normal distribution
z_test_per_replicate_transformation.rds - This file includes z-score transformed data for each replicate
z_test_final_values.rds - This file includes all final z-scores used to assess significance
log2_MMEJNHEJ_differentials_chromatin_KO - This file includes ∆log2 MMEJ:NHEJ scores for each IPR-KO combination and chromatin scores
global_diff_MMEJNHEJ - This file includes all global changes

Files created during the CCD analysis of DR proteins.
All files will include datetags that show the date they were generated. Older versions will be moved to 'old_files' directory.
This directory only contains intermediate files. Data tables that were used to generate final figures are in the main folder.

File list:
log2_MMEJ_NHEJ_ratios.rds - This file includes all the log2 transformed MMEJNHEJ balance scores
z_scores_IPR_log2.rds - This file includes z-score normalized values for each IPR. This file is used to filter out proteins that do not perturb MMEJ:NHEJ balance
fold_change_ratio_KO.rds - (Main folder) This file includes log2 fold change of KO proteins per IPR
fold_change_ratio_WT.rds - This file includes log2 fold change of NT samples per IPR
fold_change_ratio_POLQ.rds - This file includes log2 fold changes of POLQ KO (positive control) samples per IPR
CCD_model_values_NT.rds - This file includes principal component regression p-values for NT controls.
DR_KO_CCD_summary.rds - (Main folder) This file includes all values needed for DR protein KO CCDs. This is the file that I mainly use for figure generation.
