#Date: 20211208

#Experimental set up

Step_1 : Cell plating
Step_2 : Lbrary transfection (KO gRNA transfection), we do not have an estimation of this transfection efficiency or KO efficiency estimation.
Step_3 : Wait for 5 days (generate KOs)
Step_4 : LBR2 gRNA transfection, this is the gRNA that will induce the DSB in the 19 reporters (all the measurements we have: gene editing frequency or mutation frequency is on this second transfection)
Step_5 : Three days later, harvest and collect

#Explanation of each column in the data table "xv20211208_sample_dataset_variance_test"

gene = Either WT or one of the KO genes: POLL (big difference between replicates), FANCM (clear effect) and POLQ (no difference)
barcode = sequence tag to identify each of the 19 locations in the genome
chrom.4 = Four chromatin categories created by characterization of the locations where 19 reporters are integrated
rep = replicate (R1, R4 or R5)
freqMMEJ = frequency of 7 nt deletion
freqNHEJ = frequency of 1 nt insertion
freqCut = frequency of gene editing (1 - freq no indel)
MMEJscore = Relative frequency of MMEJ over NHEJ (freqMMEJ/(freqMMEJ + freqNHEJ))
indelreads = absolute number of read counts with a mutation (to get a stable MMEJscore measurements we need enough indelreads)
plate & well = position identifiers in the plate

#Explanation of each column in the data table "xv20211209_sample_dataset_variance_test_processed"

This data table contains the z-score transformation and z-score value per chromatin category

gene, barcode, chrom.4, rep, plate & well = The same as before
mmej.z.score = MMEJscore z-transformed per reporter and sample (mean and sd of the WT population in the same replicate)
mmej.chrom.score = Mean z-score between reporters in the same chromatin category (total of 4)
