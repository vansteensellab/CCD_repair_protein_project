High-throughput sequencing data was pre-processed with two different pipelines depending on the type of data:
  Sequencing based repair pathway assay data deposited in SRA - Indel scoring pipeline (Step 2 in analysis diagram) {Schep, 2022, 35173762}
  TCGA HNSCC tumour data analysis - BRASS pipeline with modification (by Mathijs Sanders).

After preprocessing, all the data for this manuscript is processed in these three scripts:
  1: xvDT_screen_data_processing_CCD.Rmd (screen data)
  2: xvDT_repair_inhibitor_CCD_calculation_lm.Rm (validation inhibitors)
  3: xvDT_FA_SCC_mutations.Rmd (TCGA tumor analysis)
  
DT = datetag, different version of the same file will be found if this scripts are rerun.
This datetag fits with the day, I run the script and created that version

The data tables needed to create the figures were exported into data/processed_data in .rds format
The intermediate data tables were exported into:
  "data/processed_data/CCD_analysis" in the case of screening and 
  "data/processed_data/CCD_inhibitors" in the case of the validation inhibitors experiment.
