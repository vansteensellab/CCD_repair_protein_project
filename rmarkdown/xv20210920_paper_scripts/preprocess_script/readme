High-throughput sequencing data was pre-processed with two different pipelines depending on the type of data:
  Sequencing based repair pathway assay data deposited in SRA - Indel scoring pipeline (Step 2 in analysis diagram) {Schep, 2022, 35173762}
  TCGA HNSCC tumour data analysis - BRASS and indelClassification pipeline with modification (by Mathijs Sanders).
  The rest of the tumor data analysis was mapped by Mathijs.

After preprocessing, all the data for this manuscript is processed in these seven scripts:
  1: xvDT_screen_data_processing_CCD.Rmd (screen data)
  2: xvDT_siRNA_data_processing_CCD.Rmd (re-analysis of Ruben's data)
  3: xvDT_PRO_valindation_data_processing_CCD.Rm (RPE-1 p53KO validation experiments)
  4: xvDT_DEF_valindation_data_processing_CCD.Rm (RPE-1 p53/BRCA1dKO validation experiments)
  5: xvDT_repair_inhibitor_CCD_calculation_lm.Rm (validation inhibitors)
  6: xvDT_ATM_inhibitor_data_processing.Rm (ATM inhibitor in RPE-1 data)
  7: xvDT_FA_SCC_mutations.Rmd (Processing of BRCA2 data from Mathijs paper)
  
DT = datetag, different version of the same file will be found if this scripts are rerun.
This datetag fits with the day, I run the script and created that version

The data tables needed to create the figures were exported into data/processed_data in .rds format
The intermediate data tables were exported into:
  "data/processed_data/CCD_analysis" in the case of screening,
  "data/processed_data/CCD_siRNA" in the case of the re-analysis of Ruben's data,
  "data/processed_data/CCD_validation_RPE1" in the case of the validation experiments in RPE-1 data (p53KO, p53/BRCA1dKO and ATM inhibitor data) and 
  "data/processed_data/CCD_inhibitors" in the case of the validation inhibitors experiment.
